1. install packages GenomicRanges, glmnet, data.table, R.utils, and REMP
2. Open function.study.name.download_files.SEQ_genome_trial_geneEXPLORE_save_train.r
Input "study" variable, which is study abbreiviation at TCGA 
Default is BRCA - breast cancer. Full list of abbreviation is available at https://gdc.cancer.gov/resources-tcga-users/tcga-code-tables/tcga-study-abbreviations

Input: study <- "BRCA" # study abbrevication name; enhancer.range <- 1e7 # methylation range 10Mbp from promoter
Output:
all.cv.R2: cross-validated R2.
train.models: output of cv.glmnet - trained model
To get coefficients of methylation probes for specific a gene 
fit <- train.models[[which(names(train.models) == "CHMP1B")]]
coef(fit$cv.fit)

2. Run function.study.name.download_files.SEQ_genome_trial_geneEXPLORE_save_train.r
